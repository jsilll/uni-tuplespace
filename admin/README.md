# Tuplespaces - Admin

This is the admin module of the Tuplespaces project.

The admin depends on the contract module, where the protocol buffers shared between server and admin are defined. The admin needs to know the interface to make remote calls.

## Instructions for using Maven

Make sure that you installed the contract module first.

To compile and run the client:

```
mvn compile exec:java
```
