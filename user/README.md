# Tuplespaces - User

This is the user module of the Tuplespaces project.

The user depends on the contract module, where the protocol buffers shared between server and user are defined. The user needs to know the interface to make remote calls.

## Instructions for using Maven

Make sure that you installed the contract module first.

To compile and run the client:

```
mvn compile exec:java
```
